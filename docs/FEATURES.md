# Careera — Feature Tracker

This document splits the backend and deployment work into independent, parallelizable features. It is designed so that multiple developers can work on features concurrently without causing merge conflicts. 

> **Rule:** Claim a feature in your project task board or chat before starting. Open a single PR per feature.
