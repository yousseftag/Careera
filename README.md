## Vision

Careera is a collaborative open-source project built by the **AppsBuild community**. It helps users navigate their career journey using AI — upload your CV, get matched to career paths that suit your profile, and follow a structured sequence of learning modules, hands-on projects, and mock interviews, all evaluated in real time by AI.

Progress is tracked with an XP and leveling system, and users can see how they rank on a global leaderboard.

## Features

**🔍 AI-Driven Career Analysis**
Upload your resume and optionally upload your LinkedIn profile as a PDF, set your preferences, and let AI analyze your hard and soft skills to generate ranked career recommendations with match scores and skill gap breakdowns.

**🗺️ Personalized Learning Paths**
From any recommendation, generate a fully structured career path — a sequential chain of nodes covering learning materials, real-world projects, and interview prep. Each node unlocks only after the previous one is completed.

**⚡ Interactive Sessions**
- **Learning nodes** — AI-generated study content with key concepts and curated resources.
- **Project nodes** — Task-based coding challenges with subtask-level AI grading and feedback.
- **Interview nodes** — Q&A sessions where each answer is evaluated and scored by AI.

**🏆 Gamification**
Earn XP for completing nodes, level up your profile, and compete on a monthly or all-time leaderboard.

**👤 Profile Management**
Update your CV, LinkedIn profile PDF, and career preferences at any time to re-run fresh analyses as you grow.
